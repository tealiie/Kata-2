# JavaScript Kata: Objects and Arrays

## Introduction

In these exercises we'll practise some of the fundamentals of JavaScript and start learning about testing. We're going to start getting used to seeing tests coloured RED, and writing code to make them go GREEN.


## Installation

First, jump into a working directory and clone the repository from GitHub. Don't forget, you can use the `TAB` key to complete long directory names (but not GitHub URLs!) Replace `cohort-year` with, for example, `kea-2015`.

```
cd workspace
git clone https://github.com/cohort-year/js-kata-objects-and-arrays
cd js-kata-objects-and-arrays
npm install
```

The last command installs a bunch of stuff that you'll need to make the exercise work correctly. Wait till it's done, then type:

```
npm test
```

You'll see some red output that looks like this:

```
   1 failed


   1. makeObject makes objects
     
  t.deepEqual(actual, expected)
              |       |        
              null    Object{a:1}
  
      Test.fn (kata-1.test.js:11:5)
npm ERR! Test failed.  See above for more details.
```

The most important thing is not to panic! Welcome to your first introduction to testing. In this challenge, you're going to make all the tests go GREEN. It's rather addictive once you get started...


## Kata

"Kata" is a concept from martial arts meaning a sequence of moves composed into a "form". Martial artists practise kata to build a "muscle-memory" for the basic moves. By practicing kata the artist hopes to make the basics of their art instinctual. When danger strikes the basics will be so familiar that they can respond without thinking.

The `kata` folder has 2 files `kata-1.js` and `kata-2.js`. These files have a series of incomplete functions with comments describing what they ought to do. Every time you run the tests (using `npm test`) you're checking to see if you've completed each function correctly. When you finish the first one, it will show up GREEN and you'll see the next RED test.

Let's try it! Open `kata-1.js` in your editor. The first function looks like this:

```js
// makeObject should return an object like this:
// {
//   key: value
// }
function makeObject (key, value) {
}
```

Ok, so it wants us to create an object with a certain key and value, whatever's passed to us. Let's solve it so we can make the test go GREEN:

```js
function makeObject (key, value) {
  var result = {}
  result[key] = value
  return result
}
```

Next, go back to your terminal window and type `npm test`:

```
   1 passed
   1 failed


   1. getValue gets values from objects
     
  t.is(actual, expected)
       |       |        
       null    1        
  
      Test.fn (kata.test.js:17:5)
```

One passed! Some coding pairs choose to treat these as high-five moments... we'll let you decide for yourselves.

Notice that the red part of the message has now changed. It's giving us a different message about another function that's not (yet) doing what it's supposed to do. Notice also that it's _expecting_ the number 1, and it's _actually getting_ `null`. The test is trying to give us as much information as possible about what we need to do next.

This way we can practise the basics of JavaScript and build up our muscle memory: 
 * reading the requirements
 * thinking and talking about how to solve the problem
 * writing code
 * running the tests using `npm test`
 * reading the red errors
 * rinse and repeat until the test passes
 
In later challenges we're going to become a lot more familiar with this process. A pattern very similar to this is known as Test Driven Development (TDD).

Once you have completed all the functions in `kata/kata-1.js` and all those tests are passing, move on to `kata/kata-2.js` and keep repeating the same process.
